Add descriptive hotspots to your images.


== Description ==

Use the Image Hotspots app to add interactive areas on top of your images. This is useful when you want to cross-sell products. You can shoot photos that contain more items at once and link to each one of them.

This approach will also inspire your users to combine your products in different ways. For example, you can show them how to combine a jacket with a skirt and a pair of shoes.

Another idea is to present product features by describing different elements of an image. This makes even the most complicated products look easy.
